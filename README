KickOff is a web application for sports-based calendar subscriptions.

Originally developed as a prototype for the 2006 World Cup, the KickOff model extended into EURO 2008, Formula 1, 6 Nations rugby and the Rugby World Cup.
This application is bringing together all these sports into a centralised system to support more sports, competitions and tournaments.

The first edition will be built to support our existing network, establishing a sound robust API for managing these sites.

The second edition will allow anyone to create their own calendar to share with the public. This will evolve over time.
