KickOff is a web application for sports-based calendar subscriptions.

Originally developed as a prototype for the 2006 World Cup, the KickOff franchise extended into EURO 2008, Formula 1, 6 Nations rugby and the Rugby World Cup.
This application is bringing together all these sports into a centralised system to support more sports, competitions and tournaments.
