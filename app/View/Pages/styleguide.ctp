<h1>Style Guide</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This guide sets out to demonstrate how Kick Off content is presented in it's many forms, initially online (web) then into other formats (plain text or code).</p>

<h2>Organising elements</h2>

<p>Always consider how to group content together in the most <em>semantic</em> way possible. This could consist of <strong>paragraphs</strong>, <strong>un-ordered lists</strong>, <strong>ordered lists</strong> or <strong>tables</strong>.</p>

<h3>Paragraphs</h3>
<p>Paragraphs should be used sparingly on Kick Off as users tend to glance over them. </p>

<h3>Un-ordered lists</h3>
<ul>
	<li>List items show concise information that are easily digestable.</li>
	<li>They are best used to present multiple relative items, no more than a few lines long.</li>
	<li>These items don't have any particular emphasis on order, hence why they are in an <em>un-ordered list</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ordered lists</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Only use ordered lists when sequential order is required.</li>
	<li>Did we really need to apply it to this?</li>
	<li>Are you sure?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tables</h3>
<p>When working with data, tables are often a suitable option as they group information in organised and semantic ways. Consider the followingâ€¦</p>
<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th rowspan="2">Position</th>
			<th rowspan="2">Team</th>
			<th rowspan="2">Played</th>
			<th colspan="3">Results</th>

		</tr>

			<th>Win</th>
			<th>Draw</th>
